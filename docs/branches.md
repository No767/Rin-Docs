# Branches

There are 2 main branches: master and dev. Master is the branch that contains the stable code. This is meant later on for production use. Dev is where all of the code gets pushed and made. If you want the latest and greatest, check out the dev branch
  
If you are still confused by this, here's a table to help you.

| Branch | Purpose of Branch |
|  :--:  |    :--:           |
| Master | Stable Code only meant for production use |
| Dev | Unstable code that includes features being worked on. This is the branch to test certain stuff, and to add new code and features until it's deemed complete and/or stable. Please note that if you want to contribute, if it's not for a fix, please pr into the dev branch instead. This way I'm able to recieve the newest updates |

# Release Target

Rin is fairly close to V1 Release. V0 is currently development/semi-stable releases of Rin, and V1 will be LTS and for production use. Rin will be hosted on Azure, and will be running nearly 24/7 unless it's for code changes or maintenance. Rin has still some work left for me to finish, and that's going to take time. The plan is to fully release it around the hoilday season, but with the idea of new features being added, this may be pushed back.
