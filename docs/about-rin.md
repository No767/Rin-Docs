# About Rin

Rin is a discord bot made in Python that is built with EasyBot.py support. Currently, it is in alpha stages, so there isn't a lot of features within the bot so far. This bot is focused on first class plugin support, and having features that some bots don't have. This is more meant to be a general-use bot. The project is basically done by 1 person (as of writing this on 8/11/2021), with the upstream lib (EasyBot.py) being done by another person. The bot is made for more of a general purpose use, and will have docker containers as needed. 

This was done as a side project, so the main dev (No767) doesn't have enough time to fully expand on it due to school and other factors

## Updated Version

Rin is a discord bot that has EasyBot.py plugin support and focuses on third party API support. These include Twitter, Instagram, Spiget, MCSrvStat, Hypixel, and tons of others.
